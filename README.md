## Portfolio project I'm working on in my free time.
You can safely ignore this. I have it set as Public just because I can. The code is very bad.
### You can see the site in action at https://saqinnoor.github.io/Portfolio/. Also, please visit this site on a PC, as that's how I originally designed it to be. I later did make it responsive for phones, but it does not have the same level of polish as the PC version.
